# XGBOOST

### PREDICTING THE BREAST CANCER USING XGBOOST

- XGBoost, which stands for Extreme Gradient Boosting, is a scalable, distributed gradient-boosted decision tree (GBDT) machine learning library
- It is an implementation of gradient boosted decision trees designed for speed and performance
- It provides parallel tree boosting and is the leading machine learning library for regression, classification, and ranking problems
- In this project, at first the dataset is loaded and pre-processing steps are carried out
- Then, by using XGBOOST MODEL, the pre-processed data are trained and tested
- Finally, the accuracy of the trained model is predicted
